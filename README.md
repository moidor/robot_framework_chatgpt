Project : Robot Framework ChatGPT
This personal project aims to manipulate the OpenAI's API using different libraries such as Selenium, Database, OperatingSystem, String, Collections and so on. By this project, we are, for instance, able to ask ChatGPT:
- to produce a text or an image from a hard disk text file, a Robot Framework template, etc. 
- to google the ChatGPT answer
But also:
- to insert produced data in a local SQLite database
- to retrieve data with a SQL query using a wild card
- copy the conversation into a text file locally saved
- to execute tests based on their tags through a command line integrated in a keyword
NOTES: 
1. The personal API key generated by OpenAI on the user's account is stored in a simple variable in a robot class. As a result, the latter will not be pushed on GitHub.
2. If the user spent all the available credits to generate contents, it will be required to buy some on OpenAI at this address : https://platform.openai.com/usage
